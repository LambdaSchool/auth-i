# Verifying HTTP Methods with `curl`

- see also `man curl`

## 1. **POST**ing JSON objects to the '/users' route:
Just like the Postman application, `curl` can send data through JSON objects:
```js
{
  "username":"some_name",
  "password":"correcthorsebatterystaple"
}
```
...and get the corresponding passwordHash in return:

```console
$  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"Bingo The Clown-o","password":"soincrediblyhardtohackthis"}' http://localhost:3000/users
  {"__v":0,"username":"Bingo The Clown-o","passwordHash":"$2a$11$lRHrlFuPWszbfzgvBw8NMehZ.M0zh/E/rv6Fx6NH1xaIFAFBGnJmm","_id":"599fa94427b8c3d1e2866d91"}
```

1. `-X` specifies the HTTP method type
2. `-H` specifies the data type
3. `-d` is for the actual data


## 2. **GET**ting with persistent cookies from '/view-counter':

As an example, in Karthikâ€™s demo viddy, he made the '/view-counter' route:
```js
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');

const server = express();
server.use(bodyParser.json());

server.use(session({
  secret: 'e5SPiqsEtjexkTj3Xqovsjzq8ovjfgVDFMfUzSmJO21dtXs4re',
}));

server.get('/view-counter', (req, res) => {
  const persistentSession = req.session;
  if (!persistentSession.viewCount) {
    persistentSession.viewCount = 0;
  }
  persistentSession.viewCount++;
  res.json({ viewCount: persistentSession.viewCount });
});

module.exports = { server };
```

To
1. visit that route,
2. GET the counter and
3. set `curl` up for persistent cookies,
...first enter this in your console:

```console
$ curl -v http://localhost:3000/view-counter
```

The `-v` option sets `curl` up to use a persistent cookie.

This is the first visit, so using this command will return the data object, { viewCount: 1 }.

NOTE also - and this is the important bit: towards the bottom of the `curl` print out, just above the view count, look for the `set-cookie` data:

```console
$  curl -v http://localhost:3000/view-counter
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (::1) port 3000 (#0)
    > GET /view-counter HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:3000
    > User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < X-Powered-By: Express
    < Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    < Content-Length: 15
    < ETag: W/"f-S/x5i6y+O5xz5+BJCJHSQTCJ6H4"
                  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv---just this bit---vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    < set-cookie: connect.sid=s%3AY_yUqVkQUnUMWxkpDMiMqXZh-oTHqmby.H%2F8Jy3vQ52mNrj2BtytRRdlyQZxl5dWWdAu07QV8jNs; Path=/; HttpOnly
    < Date: Fri, 25 Aug 2017 03:42:32 GMT
    < Connection: keep-alive
    <
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
    {"viewCount":1}    <---------------------------------- Hey, whaddya know????
```

Copy the ONLY `connect.sid` assignment,
i.e. `connect.sid=SUPERLONGSTRING_UP_UNTIL_THE_SEMI-COLON`
...and then paste that into a `curl` command as the `-b` argument.
This time you can leave off the `-v` option, but you also need the -H option to tell gurl what kind of data is being sent:

i.e

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "NAME=VALUE" http://localhost:3000/view-counter
```

Now, when you enter this command into your console, the view counter will increase by one with each successive visit through `curl`!

e.g.
```console
$  curl -v http://localhost:3000/view-counter
    ...           vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv--just copy this bit--vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    < set-cookie: connect.sid=s%3AK-2XUQqoT4Cw7JPo_VIhXGIq03g8FTdv.xfw%2FCxZugBVxj2CGpBMPcK9R%2FrSTmXbdk6IXHSgQiCA; Path=/; HttpOnly
    ...
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
    {"viewCount":1}  <--------------------------------------------- Lookie Thar!

$  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "connect.sid=s%3AK-2XUQqoT4Cw7JPo_VIhXGIq03g8FTdv.xfw%2FCxZugBVxj2CGpBMPcK9R%2FrSTmXbdk6IXHSgQiCA" -v http://localhost:3000/view-counter
    {"viewCount":2}    <------------------------------------------------ YaY!!!!

$  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "connect.sid=s%3AK-2XUQqoT4Cw7JPo_VIhXGIq03g8FTdv.xfw%2FCxZugBVxj2CGpBMPcK9R%2FrSTmXbdk6IXHSgQiCA" -v http://localhost:3000/view-counter
    {"viewCount":3}    <------------------------------ Third time's a charm!!!!!

```
